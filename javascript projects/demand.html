    <h1>Demand Forecast for Market Basket Analysis</h1>

  <div class="di">
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Demand forecasting supports businesses in making intelligent supply decisions by estimating future sales and revenue. It enables organizations to optimize inventories and make informed decisions, ranging from supply planning to meeting consumer expectations based on past sales data.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>1. Introduction
  Businesses today use ever-increasing precision marketing techniques to stay competitive and increase their 
  profit margin. Forecasting models play a major role in precision marketing to figure out and meet customer 
  desires and expectations. At different planning levels, various organizational units use forecasts as the 
  foundation for their action plans. Sales forecasts are typically made by managers using their opinions, instincts, 
  and experience. It is extremely hard to constantly acquire reliable data from such highly skilled managers since 
  it may differ from person to person. Machine Learning can therefore aid in decision-making by projecting sale 
  in the future. Utilizing the enormous quantity of data and its related information, machine learning algorithms 
  can be used to develop efficient sales prediction models.
  Demand forecasting is a technique that uses historical sales data to estimate current customer demand 
  prediction. Its tools make it easier for businesses to implement their strategic and management level plans 
  operationally. Demand forecasting in supply chain management has utilized a number of statistical analysis 
  techniques, including time-series analysis and regression analysis.
  The traditional approaches to demand forecasting are based on statistical analysis of past data, whereas 
  those are evolving towards intelligent forecasts, which can intelligently learn from historical data and adapt to 
  predict the changing demand in supply chains. A supply chain's performance is positively impacted by accurate 
  demand planning and sales forecasting. Hence a demand planning aims to create a forecasting model that 
  supports decision-makers in the fields of manufacturing, distribution, and sales.
  In demand forecasting, Machine learning algorithms can examine past sales patterns and forecast future 
  trends. Data on previous sales, including the type of goods, the quantity sold, the frequency of purchases, the 
  season, discounts, and other factors, are initially collected. The algorithm uses this data to build models that 
  track changing sales patterns. Once these patterns are discovered, they can be used to produce a precise trend 
  forecast. Data is used by machine learning algorithms to discover patterns and trends in datasets and based on 
  that a suitable model is produced. The forecasting model improves in precision when more data is regularly 
  added to the system. </p>
  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>Machine learning is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that makes use of advanced algorithms to gain 
  insight from data. It can be used for a variety of things, like anticipating consumer behavior, enhancing internet 
  search results, even aiding in the diagnosis of medical illness and avoiding fraudulent transactions. In demand 
  forecasting, the machine learning algorithms are capable of estimating demand by analyzing past sales patterns. 
  This can be done using many kinds of machine learning classification techniques, which select the optimal 
  model for the dataset. Machine learning algorithms rely on data to discover patterns and trends in datasets. 
  In general, forecasting future sales is about obtaining sales information from a store over a 
  predetermined time period and making projections using a number of prediction techniques. Sales forecasting 
  can be influenced by a variety of aspects, such as direct and indirect competition, state and local holidays, 
  demographic shifts, promotional deals etc. The above-mentioned aspects lead to significant variations in 
  predicted sales while using the existing method, which fails to provide accurate results as, anticipated. 
  The proposed method uses various analysis techniques to predict data from the past sales history of the 
  daily total sales of 10 shops. Using the whole dataset, the analysis generates predictions for the subsequent year. 
  Data is forecasted using algorithms like Time series analysis, Light Gradient Boosting Machine Regression, so 
  that predictions may be compared across all results to find the best accurate result. The algorithm's predicted 
  data are put forth, and an ideal efficient result set is found for sales forecasting. The algorithm uses time series 
  data to anticipate data for the future year resulting in less change over time and data. It is possible to split a time 
  series into individual components in order to systematically learn, analyze, model, and predict it. In order to 
  maximize the likelihood of making the most accurate predictions, seasonality's variability and impact are being 
  closely observed.</p>

  <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
    <img src="re1.png" alt="Image 1 Description">
    <p>Taking into account 5 years of data (Jan 2018â€“Dec 2022) the quantity of sales for the upcoming 12 months 
    using this data is predicted. The sum of sales for 50 different items at 10 different stores is shown in Figure 3.2.</p>

    <img src="re2.jpg" alt="Image 2 Description">
    <p>data appears to be non-stationary because, when the totaldaily sales are plotted over time, the average daily sales increase over time. To make the datastationary, will compute the difference in monthly sales and add it as a newcolumn to ourdataframe.</p>

    <img src="re3.jpg" alt="Image 3 Description">
    <p>a graph showing expected sales for the last 12 months can be seen, indicating that the prediction is accurate.The model is competent and makes predictions that seem reasonable.</p>
